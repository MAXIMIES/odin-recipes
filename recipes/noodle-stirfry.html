      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple noodle dish i make when i need a quick and tasty meal. It has those simple yet powerful elements i love about this "takeaway"-style chinese cooking, it's sweet, it's savory and even a tiny bit tangy. Very easy to make, you basically just prep everything and it cooks in 15 minutes. Feel free to change vegetables to your liking.
