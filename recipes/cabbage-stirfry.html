      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        An other simple meal with loads of taste. I'we made this out of multiple different styles of cabbages, so feel free to experiment. The Sichuan peppercorns bring the whole recipe together, giving this dish a unique taste that i get a craving for regurally

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 medium head of green cabbage (about 1.5 pounds)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>3 dired chili peppers, cut into small pieces with a kitchen scissor</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon szechuan peppercorns</li>

        <li>½ tablespoon Chinese vinegar</li>

      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Halve the cabbage with a knife and remove the core; tear the leaves into 3-inch wide pieces with hand (I prefer leaving the stems out and only keep the tender leaves)</li>>            
            <li>Whisk together soy sauce, Chinese vinegar, sugar and salt in a small container, set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into the pan, add in the dried chili pepper and szechuan peppercorns, turn to low heat and sauté a minute or until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Toss in the garlic and sauté until fragrant under low heat.</li>
            <li>Add in the cabbage and turn to medium heat, cook about 3 minutes or until soft.</li>
            <li>Give the sauce (previously set aside) a light stir before adding into the pan, stir to mix well, cook for a minute under high heat or until the seasoning's evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate and serve!</li>
          </ol>
