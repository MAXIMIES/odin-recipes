This is an HTML lesson in wich i build a website with links to recipes.

A fairly straightforward lesson, i felt like i was able to follow it with ease and was able to use what i had learned so far.

The recipes can be navigated through the list of links in the index page. Every recipe has a link back to the index, at the bottom of the recipe.
